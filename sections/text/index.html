In the Western imagination, <br>
reason has long belonged to terra firma<br><br>
 Island or continent<br>
 it repels water with a solid stubbornness<br>
 it only concedes its sand <br><br>
As for unreason<br><br>
      it has been aquatic <br>
      from the depths of time <br>
      and that until fairly recently<br> 
And more precisely oceanic<br><br>
      infinite space<br> 
uncertain… <br>
Madness is the flowing liquid exterior of rocky reason<br><br>

She was staring at the water <br><br>
it seemed sadder and darker here<br>

<br>
Followed by another<br>
      And another and another <br><br>
and only then did Tereza realize <br>
     <br>
away from the city<br><br>
more and more <br>
drifting by like the autumn leaves that the water<br>
carries off from the woods <br>
red, yellow, blue.<br><br>

Why are Prague’s park benches floating downstream? <br>
But everyone passed her by<br>
 indifferent<br>
 for little did they care<br>
Again she looked down at the river <br><br>
She understood that what she saw was a farewell<br>

      I looked at the ocean, too<br>
It’s a marvelous thing <br>the ocean<br>
For some reason when two people sit together looking out at it<br> they stop caring whether they talk or stay silent<br>
You never get tired of watching it<br><br>
 And no matter how rough the waves get <br> you’re never bothered <br>by the noise the water makes or by the commotion of the surface<br>
it never seems too loud<br> or too wild<br><br>

I simply couldn’t believe that I was about to move to a place where
there was no ocean.<br>
 Somehow it didn’t register<br> it was so strange that just thinking about it made me uneasy.<br>
 Because the ocean had always been there<br> in the good times as well as the bad times of my life<br><br>

 when it was sweltering out and the beach was filled with people<br>
 and in the dead of winter when the sky was heavy with stars<br>
 and when we were heading to thelocal shrine on New Year’s Day. . .<br>
 all I had to do was turn my head and it would be there<br> the same as always<br> <br>
      
I exist. <br>
It's sweet, so sweet, so slow<br>
And light: you'd think it floated all by itself. <br>
It stirs. It brushes by me, melts and vanishes. <br>
Gently, gently. <br><br>

There is bubbling water in my throat, it caresses me <br>
 For ever I shall have a little pool of whitish water in my mouth <br>
 lying low, grazing my tongue <br><br>
 And this pool is still me<br>
 And the tongue. And the throat is me...<br>

Perhaps he could dance first and think afterwards, <br>if it isn't
too much to ask him.<br>
Would that be possible?<br>
By all means, nothing simpler.<br> It's the natural order.<br>
He laughs briefly.<br>
Then let him dance.<br><br>
Silence<br><br>
      
      I remember the maps of the Holy Land.<br> Coloured they were.<br>
Very pretty. <br>The Dead Sea was pale blue.<br>
      The very look of it made me thirsty. <br>
      That's where we'll go,<br> I used to say, that's<br>
where we'll go for our honeymoon. <br>We'll swim.<br> We'll be happy. <br><br>



Black lake, black boat, two black, cut-paper people.<br>
Where do the black trees go that drink here?<br>
Their shadows must cover Canada.<br><br>

A little light is filtering from the water flowers.<br>
Their leaves do not wish us to hurry:<br>
They are round and flat and full of dark advice.<br><br>

Cold worlds shake from the oar.<br>
The spirit of blackness is in us, it is in the fishes.<br>
A snag is lifting a valedictory, pale hand;<br><br>

Stars open among the lilies.<br>
Are you not blinded by such expressionless sirens?<br>
This is the silence of astounded souls.<br><br>

"Where is he?" I say.<br> "Where is Dean?"<br>
"Outside," my husband says.<br>
He drains his glass and stands up. He says, "I think I know what you need." <br><br>

He reaches an arm around my waist and with his other hand he begins to unbutton my jacket and then he goes on to the buttons of my blouse.<br>
"First things first," he says.<br><br>
He says something else. <br>But I don’t need to listen.<br> I can’t hear a thing with so much water going.<br><br>
"That’s right," I say, finishing the buttons myself, "Before Dean comes. Hurry?" <br><br>

The trees in the yard were still dripping their heavy burden of rainwater.<br><br>

‘We’re in the eye of the storm,’ my father told me.<br>
 ‘It’ll stay quiet like this for a while, maybe fifteen, twenty minutes, kind of like an intermission.<br> Then the wind’ll come back the way it was before.’<br><br>

‘Where are you going?’ he asked.<br>

‘Just down to look at the beach,’ I said.<br><br>
      
      "What's the name of the song?"<br>
"'Kafka on the Shore.'" Oshima says.<br>
"'Kafka on the Shore'?"<br>
"That's correct, Kafka Tamura. The same name as you. A strange coincidence,<br>
don't you think?"<br><br>
"But Kafka isn't my real name. Tamura is, though."<br>
"But you chose it yourself, right?"<br>
I nod. I'd decided a long time ago that this was the right name for the new me.<br>
"That's the point, I'd say," Oshima says <br><br>
